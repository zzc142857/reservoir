 \section{Measures}
\begin{question}{1}
Let $E$ be a set. What is a $\sigma$-algebra $\curE$ on $E$? What is a set function? What is a measure? What is a measurable space? What is a measure space?

What is a mass function on $E$? Show that if $E$ is countable with $\curE = 2^E$, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between measures on $(E,\curE)$ and mass functions on $E$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}{2}
Let $\curA \subset 2^E$. What is the $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(\curA)$ generated by $\curA$? Show that $\sigma(\curA)$ is indeed a $\sigma$-algebra.

Let $\curA \subset 2^E$.  When is $\curA$ a $\pi$-system on $E$? When is $\curA$ a $d$-system on $E$? Show that a $\pi$-system that is a $d$-system is a $\sigma$-algebra. 

Let $\curD$ be a $d$-system on set $E$. Let $\curA$ be a subset of $\curD$. Show that $\curD' = \{B\in \curD: B\cap A \in \curD \text{ for all } A\in \curA\}$ is a $d$-system. State and prove Dynkin's $\pi$-system lemma.

Let $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ be two finite measures on $(E,\curE)$ and $\mu_1(E) = \mu_2(E)$. Suppose $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ agree on a generating $\pi$-system $\curA$ of $\curE$, show that $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ everywhere on $\curE$. 

Suppose instead $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are $\sigma$-finite measures such that $E \subset \bigcup_n E_n$ for some disjoint sequence $(E_n)$ in $\curA$, and $\mu_1(E_n) = \mu_2(E_n)$ for all $n$, does the result still hold? Justify your answers.

\end{question}

\begin{question}{3}
(Alternatively, state and prove the Caratheodory extension theorem.)

Let $E$ be a set. Explain a ring of subsets on $E$ and an algebra of subsets on $E$. Show that a countably additive set function on a ring is increasing and countably subadditive.

Let $\curA$ be a ring on $E$ and $\mu : \curA \rightarrow [0,\infty]$ be a countably additive set function. Define the outer measure $\mu^*$ on $E$ and the collection $\curM$ of $\mu^*$-measurable sets on $E$. Show that $\mu^*$ is a countably subadditive increasing set function.

Show that $\mu^*$ agrees with $\mu$ on $\curA$. Then, show that $\curA \subset \curM$.

Show that $\curM$ is an algebra. Hence, show that $\curM$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Deduce that $\mu^*$ is a measure restricted to the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\curA$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}{4}
Let $E$ be a Hausdorff space. Explain a Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $E$. Let $\curB$ be the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\R$ with the usual topology. Show that $\curB$ is generated by the open intervals in $\R$.

Define $\mu(A) = \Sigma_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)$ for $A = (a_1,b_1] \cup \dots \cup (a_n,b_n]$ in $\curA$. Show that $\mu$ is well-defined and additive on $\curA$.

 Show that  $\mu$ is countably additive.  Hence, show that there exists a unique Borel measure $\mu$ on $\R$ such that $\mu((a,b]) = b-a$ for every interval $(a,b] \subset \R$. Deduce that $\mu$ is translational invariant.

Is every subset of $\R$ a Borel set? Justify your answer. 
\end{question}

\begin{question}{5}
Let $(\Omega, \curF,\P)$ be a probability space. Explain when a sequence $(\curA_n)$ of sub-$\sigma$-algebras of $\curF$ is independent.

Let $\curA_1$ and $\curA_2$ be two $\pi$-systems in $\curF$. Show that if $\P(A_1 \cap A_2) = \P(A_1) \P(A_2)$ for all $A_1 \in \curA_1$ and $A_2 \in \curA_2$, then $\sigma(\curA_1)$ and $\sigma(\curA_2)$ are independent. Extend the result to the case of $n$ $\pi$-systems.

State and prove the first and second Borel-Cantelli lemmas.
\end{question}

\begin{question}{1.1}
